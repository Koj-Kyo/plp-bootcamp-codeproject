# SQLAlchemy Circular Import Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing this error:
```
RuntimeError: The current Flask application was not registered with this 'SQLAlchemy' instance.
Did you forget to call 'init_app', or did you create multiple 'SQLAlchemy' instances?
```

## Root Cause
When using Flask's application factory pattern with `create_app()`, importing `db` directly from `app.py` in the models created a circular import issue:
- `app.py` imports models
- Models import `db` from `app.py`
- This causes initialization order problems

## Solution Implemented
Created a new `extensions.py` module to centralize all Flask extensions and avoid circular imports.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `extensions.py`**
   ```python
   from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
   from flask_login import LoginManager

   db = SQLAlchemy()
   login_manager = LoginManager()
   ```

2. **Updated `app.py`**
   - Changed: `from app import db`
   - To: `from extensions import db, login_manager`

3. **Updated all model files:**
   - `models/__init__.py`
   - `models/patient.py`
   - `models/doctor.py`
   - `models/health_center.py`
   - `models/appointment.py`
   - Changed: `from app import db`
   - To: `from extensions import db`

4. **Updated all route files:**
   - `routes/auth.py`
   - `routes/main.py`
   - `routes/appointments.py`
   - Changed: `from app import db`
   - To: `from extensions import db`

## Result
✅ Application now starts successfully
✅ Database tables are detected
✅ Flask server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ No more SQLAlchemy registration errors

## Best Practice
When using Flask application factory pattern:
- Always use a separate `extensions.py` file for Flask extensions
- Import extensions from `extensions.py` in all modules
- Never import `db` directly from `app.py`
